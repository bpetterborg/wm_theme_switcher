# wm_theme_switcher

Utility to automatically change the GTK and WM config based on time of day.
You would use this to have automatic dark/light theme.

This is designed to be used with Sway and i3, but I'm sure it could be ported 
easily to other WMs. If your WM is not supported, make a PR and I'll add it.
